# Web Scraper
A simple web scraper that I created. The aim of this project is to look at a given web address, and then grab all of the addresses on that page. Once that happens we have all of them for reference and are able to then go through each of those.
If you have any suggestions on what to add or change for this project they are greatly appreciated!
